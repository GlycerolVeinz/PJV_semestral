DUNGEON SIMULATOR

User should be given an option in terminal, if he wants to start simulation or leave.
    The option to leave should be always present throughout the simulation.

When the simulation starts, pre-generated empty map should appear. User is granted permission to add entities as he wills, and also start or stop simulation.
Entity spawns should be purely random

Each type of entity interacts differently with the surrounding
    -Every Humanoid is able to walkthru doors and walk on bridges
        
        -Zombies should decay to Skeletons after some time

        -Skeletons should kill any living if they come close to each other
        
        -Humans should become Zombies, if they come close to one 
        -Humans collect gold, but do not drop it on death

        -Goblins should collect gold and horde it on one big pile as a collective
        -Goblins multiply should they come close to each other

    -Any animal should be "affraid" of bridges, thus not walking on them
        
        -Wolves can eat Humans or Goblins if they come close to each other
        -Wolves become enigmas should they die

    -Any spirit should be indifferent to surrounding Tiles, only exception being walls

        -Enigmas "seek revenge" and kill any Skeleton should they come close to eachother
